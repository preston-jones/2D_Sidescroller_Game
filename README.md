CYBER CITY
---
This is a small Javascript Project I made in 2024 during my training as a Frontend Developer, at the Developer Academy Munich.
It is a 2D Sidescroller Browser Game, written in Vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS with no Framework or Engine.
The Game Art Design is in the Style of an retro 8-Bit Pixel-Art Arcade Game.

Have Fun and enjoy a little Time Trip, back at the Arcade-Game-Era.
